Run from the Wither Storm

Running from the Wither Storm has never been as fun as it is now! Vault over fences, sprint faster than ever before! Jump across wide gaps and catch the ledge, extending how far you can travel! In the nether? New grapple hooks allow you to scale high climbs, or repel back down them! They also hold you down when you're caught in a tractor beam! New enchantments include extra jumps, and sprint speed. You also can now cling onto walls to hold on to dear life!

 

This modpack is made to greatly expand on Cracker's Wither Storm Mod. I have added various animation mods and block sound mods. 

I have also adjusted the recipe for the Formidibomb to match how it's crafted in MCSM, while also not removing any ingredients from the original recipe.

 

 This modpack has also been made to enhance the multiplayer experience. Now when you die, you are incapacitated and if you aren't able to be revived, you can use golden carrots to extend how long you are incapacitated for or you can eat anything with a golden apple in it to revive yourself. There are also more armor sets with their own bonuses so you can recreate your own Order of the Stone!

 

I didn't add any performance mods, but they can be added if you wish (Optifine may not be compatibile)
